# flow-logic-traffic-signal-controll-system
Project Description This project simulates a traffic signal control system using C++ programming. It demonstrates flow logic, conditional statements, and loop control to represent real-world traffic light behavior. The system cycles through Red, Yellow, and Green signals with fixed delays, displaying the current signal status on the console.
